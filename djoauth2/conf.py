  #: The "state" parameter is used during requests for

  #: the specification ( http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12 ):
  #:
  #:     The client MUST implement CSRF protection for its redirection URI.
  #:     This is typically accomplished by requiring any request sent to the
  #:     redirection URI endpoint to include a value that binds the request to
  #:     the user-agent's authenticated state (e.g., a hash of the session
  #:     cookie used to authenticate the user-agent).  The client SHOULD utilize
  #:     the "state" request parameter to deliver this value to the
  #:     authorization server when making an authorization request.
  #:
  #: If you would like to ignore the specification's recommendations, change
  #: this value to ``False``. Sometimes this is useful during local development
  #: and testing, but this value should **never** be set to ``False`` in a
  #: production environment.

  #: From http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2.1 :
  #:
  #:     The redirection endpoint SHOULD require the use of TLS as described in
  #:     Section 1.6 when the requested response type is "code" or "token", or
  #:     when the redirection request will result in the transmission of
  #:     sensitive credentials over an open network.  This specification does
  #:     not mandate the use of TLS because at the time of this writing,
  #:     requiring clients to deploy TLS is a significant hurdle for many client
  #:     developers.  If TLS is not available, the authorization server SHOULD
  #:     warn the resource owner about the insecure endpoint prior to
  #:     redirection (e.g., display a message during the authorization request).
  #:
  #:     Lack of transport-layer security can have a severe impact on the
  #:     security of the client and the protected resources it is authorized to
  #:     access.  The use of transport-layer security is particularly critical
  #:     when the authorization process is used as a form of delegated end-user
  #:     authentication by the client (e.g., third-party sign-in service).
  #:
  #: If you'd like to develop your OAuth endpoints locally without having to set
  #: up an SSL server, change this value to ``False``. We **do not** recommend
  #: changing this value in a production environment -- the security of your
  #: users will be greatly compromised.
